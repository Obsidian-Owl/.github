# Obsidian Owl 🦉

## About

Welcome to Obsidian Owl - a space where I explore the intersection of AI and software development.

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted development workflows. With 18+ months of hands-on experience with tools like Claude Code, I've been documenting what actually works in the real world of AI-augmented coding.

## Focus Areas

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

- Practical workflows with Claude Code and other AI tools
- Quality gates and testing strategies for AI-generated code
- Managing the cognitive load of orchestrating AI agents

### 🏗️ Software Architecture

- Modular design patterns
- Interface-first development
- Shift-left practices and continuous integration

### 🚀 Modern Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust
- **Frameworks**: Encore, Express.js, Unity
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, Railway, Docker
- **AI Tools**: Claude Code, MCP Servers, Various LLMs

## Philosophy

I believe the future of software development isn't about AI replacing developers - it's about developers becoming better orchestrators and architects. My work focuses on:

- **Quality over speed**: Fast is good, but reliable is better
- **Test-driven development**: The robots love TDD, and so should you
- **Clear boundaries**: Well-designed interfaces prevent AI from creating tangled messes
- **Continuous learning**: The tools evolve quickly, but principles endure

## Projects

This organization hosts various experiments and tools related to AI-assisted development. While my larger projects remain private, I share learnings and utilities that can help other developers navigate this new landscape.
